## üßê About
The objective of this project is to create a multithread program that simulates a dinner where a 'philosopher' (thread) can eat
only if he can get two forks (there is a fork for each philosopher). After eating, the philosopher should sleep then start to think
and try to get 2 forks again. The simulation stops if a philosopher doesn't eat at a given (tiem_to_die) time or eat the maximum number of meals.

The project can be resumed in the following chart:
